# Full Stack Group Project Team Lambda- Front End

## Project Overview

After spending 9 weeks learning the basics of fullstack web development- how to build servers, create React apps and tie them together using API requests- we have been tasked with building a fullstack project to bring together everything that we have learnt so far.

## Requirements

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). For development, you will only need React installed on your environment.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

## React

React is really easy to install & now include NPM. You should be able to run the following command after the installation procedure below.

npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start

Please install Homebrew if it's not already done with the following command.
